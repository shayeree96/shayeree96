### Hi there, I'm Shayeree Sarkar, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ‘¯ I have experience in building ML projects end to end including training, profiling, optimizing, quantizing and deploying SOTA deep learning object detection models, various classification models, object tracking algorithms, developing multi-camera based object tracking using traditional CV algorithms and designing metrics to test system performance.
-  I  graduated with my Masters in ECE Department from Carnegie Mellon University in May 2021. At CMU, I had been working as a Research Assistant at Retrofit AI and Cylab CMU. My research at Retrofit AI focused on stereo and radar based 2D object detection for vehicle datasets. At Cylab, I researched on improving latency in object detection techniques, and a US patent had been filed for the work. I also worked spoken dialog systems for low resource languages which Ranked 1 for Kannada Language on on EACL-2021 Shared Task for Offensive Language Identification.
